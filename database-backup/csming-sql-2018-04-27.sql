I&#8217;m your first Markdown file in <strong>StackEdit</strong> . If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. If you have finished with me, you can just create new files by opening the <strong>file explorer</strong> on the left corner of the navigation bar.</p>&#10;<h1 id=\"files\">Files</h1>&#10;<p>StackEdit stores your files in your browser, which means all your files are automatically saved locally and are accessible <strong>offline!</strong></p>&#10;<h2 id=\"create-files-and-folders\">Create files and folders</h2>&#10;<p>The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the <strong>New file</strong> button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the <strong>New folder</strong> button.</p>&#10;<h2 id=\"switch-to-another-file\">Switch to another file</h2>&#10;<p>All your files are listed in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the list.</p>&#10;<h2 id=\"rename-a-file\">Rename a file</h2>&#10;<p>You can rename the current file by clicking the file name in the navigation bar or by clicking the <strong>Rename</strong> button in the file explorer.</p>&#10;<h2 id=\"delete-a-file\">Delete a file</h2>&#10;<p>You can delete the current file by clicking the <strong>Remove</strong> button in the file explorer. The file will be moved into the <strong>Trash</strong> folder and automatically deleted after 7 days of inactivity.</p>&#10;<h2 id=\"export-a-file\">Export a file</h2>&#10;<p>You can export the current file by clicking <strong>Export to disk</strong> in the menu. You can choose to export the file as plain Markdown, as HTML using a Handlebars template or as a PDF.</p>&#10;<h1 id=\"synchronization\">Synchronization</h1>&#10;<p>Synchronization is one of the biggest features of StackEdit. It enables you to synchronize any file in your workspace with other files stored in your <strong>Google Drive</strong> , your <strong>Dropbox</strong> and your <strong>GitHub</strong> accounts. This allows you to keep writing on other devices, collaborate with people you share the file with, integrate easily into your workflow&#8230; The synchronization mechanism takes place every minute in the background, downloading, merging, and uploading file modifications.</p>&#10;<p>There are two types of synchronization and they can complement each other:</p>&#10;<ul>&#10;<li>&#10;<p>The workspace synchronization will sync all your files, folders and settings automatically. This will allow you to fetch your workspace on any other device.</p>&#10;<blockquote>&#10;<p>To start syncing your workspace, just sign in with Google in the menu.</p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;</li>&#10;<li>&#10;<p>The file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with one or multiple files in <strong>Google Drive</strong> , <strong>Dropbox</strong> or <strong>GitHub</strong> .</p>&#10;<blockquote>&#10;<p>Before starting to sync files, you must link an account in the <strong>Synchronize</strong> sub-menu.</p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;</li>&#10;</ul>&#10;<h2 id=\"open-a-file\">Open a file</h2>&#10;<p>You can open a file from <strong>Google Drive</strong> , <strong>Dropbox</strong> or <strong>GitHub</strong> by opening the <strong>Synchronize</strong> sub-menu and clicking <strong>Open from</strong> . Once opened in the workspace, any modification in the file will be automatically synced.</p>&#10;<h2 id=\"save-a-file\">Save a file</h2>&#10;<p>You can save any file of the workspace to <strong>Google Drive</strong> , <strong>Dropbox</strong> or <strong>GitHub</strong> by opening the <strong>Synchronize</strong> sub-menu and clicking <strong>Save on</strong> . Even if a file in the workspace is already synced, you can save it to another location. StackEdit can sync one file with multiple locations and accounts.</p>&#10;<h2 id=\"synchronize-a-file\">Synchronize a file</h2>&#10;<p>Once your file is linked to a synchronized location, StackEdit will periodically synchronize it by downloading/uploading any modification. A merge will be performed if necessary and conflicts will be resolved.</p>&#10;<p>If you just have modified your file and you want to force syncing, click the <strong>Synchronize now</strong> button in the navigation bar.</p>&#10;<blockquote>&#10;<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>Synchronize now</strong> button is disabled if you have no file to synchronize.</p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h2 id=\"manage-file-synchronization\">Manage file synchronization</h2>&#10;<p>Since one file can be synced with multiple locations, you can list and manage synchronized locations by clicking <strong>File synchronization</strong> in the <strong>Synchronize</strong> sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove synchronized locations that are linked to your file.</p>&#10;<h1 id=\"publication\">Publication</h1>&#10;<p>Publishing in StackEdit makes it simple for you to publish online your files. Once you&#8217;re happy with a file, you can publish it to different hosting platforms like <strong>Blogger</strong> , <strong>Dropbox</strong> , <strong>Gist</strong> , <strong>GitHub</strong> , <strong>Google Drive</strong> , <strong>WordPress</strong> and <strong>Zendesk</strong> . With <a href=\"http://handlebarsjs.com/\">Handlebars templates</a> , you have full control over what you export.</p>&#10;<blockquote>&#10;<p>Before starting to publish, you must link an account in the <strong>Publish</strong> sub-menu.</p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h2 id=\"publish-a-file\">Publish a File</h2>&#10;<p>You can publish your file by opening the <strong>Publish</strong> sub-menu and by clicking <strong>Publish to</strong> . For some locations, you can choose between the following formats:</p>&#10;<ul>&#10;<li>Markdown: publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it ( <strong>GitHub</strong> for instance),</li>&#10;<li>HTML: publish the file converted to HTML via a Handlebars template (on a blog for example).</li>&#10;</ul>&#10;<h2 id=\"update-a-publication\">Update a publication</h2>&#10;<p>After publishing, StackEdit keeps your file linked to that publication which makes it easy for you to re-publish it. Once you have modified your file and you want to update your publication, click on the <strong>Publish now</strong> button in the navigation bar.</p>&#10;<blockquote>&#10;<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>Publish now</strong> button is disabled if your file has not been published yet.</p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h2 id=\"manage-file-publication\">Manage file publication</h2>&#10;<p>Since one file can be published to multiple locations, you can list and manage publish locations by clicking <strong>File publication</strong> in the <strong>Publish</strong> sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove publication locations that are linked to your file.</p>&#10;<h1 id=\"markdown-extensions\">Markdown extensions</h1>&#10;<p>StackEdit extends the standard Markdown syntax by adding extra <strong>Markdown extensions</strong> , providing you with some nice features.</p>&#10;<blockquote>&#10;<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> You can disable any <strong>Markdown extension</strong> in the <strong>File properties</strong> dialog.</p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h2 id=\"smartypants\">SmartyPants</h2>&#10;<p>SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into &#8220;smart&#8221; typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:</p>&#10;<p>ASCII</p>&#10;<p>HTML</p>&#10;<p>Single backticks</p>&#10;<p><code>\'Isn\'t this fun?\'</code></p>&#10;<p>&#8216;Isn&#8217;t this fun?&#8217;</p>&#10;<p>Quotes</p>&#10;<p><code>&#34;Isn\'t this fun?&#34;</code></p>&#10;<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this fun?&#8221;</p>&#10;<p>Dashes</p>&#10;<p><code>-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash</code></p>&#10;<p>&#8211; is en-dash, &#8212; is em-dash</p>&#10;<h2 id=\"katex\">KaTeX</h2>&#10;<p>You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using <a href=\"https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/\">KaTeX</a> :</p>&#10;<p>The <em>Gamma function</em> satisfying \\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\\quad\\forall n\\in\\mathbb N is via the Euler integral</p>&#10;<p>\\Gamma(z) = \\int_0^\\infty t<sup>{z-1}e</sup>{-t}dt\\,.</p>&#10;<blockquote>&#10;<p>You can find more information about <strong>LaTeX</strong> mathematical expressions <a href=\"http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference\">here</a> .</p>&#10;</blockquote>&#10;<h2 id=\"uml-diagrams\">UML diagrams</h2>&#10;<p>You can render UML diagrams using <a href=\"https://mermaidjs.github.io/\">Mermaid</a> .

I&#8217;m your first Markdown file in **StackEdit** . If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. If you have finished with me, you can just create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.&#10;&#10;Files&#10;=====&#10;&#10;StackEdit stores your files in your browser, which means all your files are automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**&#10;&#10;Create files and folders&#10;------------------------&#10;&#10;The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.&#10;&#10;Switch to another file&#10;----------------------&#10;&#10;All your files are listed in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the list.&#10;&#10;Rename a file&#10;-------------&#10;&#10;You can rename the current file by clicking the file name in the navigation bar or by clicking the **Rename** button in the file explorer.&#10;&#10;Delete a file&#10;-------------&#10;&#10;You can delete the current file by clicking the **Remove** button in the file explorer. The file will be moved into the **Trash** folder and automatically deleted after 7 days of inactivity.&#10;&#10;Export a file&#10;-------------&#10;&#10;You can export the current file by clicking **Export to disk** in the menu. You can choose to export the file as plain Markdown, as HTML using a Handlebars template or as a PDF.&#10;&#10;Synchronization&#10;===============&#10;&#10;Synchronization is one of the biggest features of StackEdit. It enables you to synchronize any file in your workspace with other files stored in your **Google Drive** , your **Dropbox** and your **GitHub** accounts. This allows you to keep writing on other devices, collaborate with people you share the file with, integrate easily into your workflow&#8230; The synchronization mechanism takes place every minute in the background, downloading, merging, and uploading file modifications.&#10;&#10;There are two types of synchronization and they can complement each other:&#10;&#10;*   The workspace synchronization will sync all your files, folders and settings automatically. This will allow you to fetch your workspace on any other device.&#10;    &#10;    &gt; To start syncing your workspace, just sign in with Google in the menu.&#10;    &#10;*   The file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with one or multiple files in **Google Drive** , **Dropbox** or **GitHub** .&#10;    &#10;    &gt; Before starting to sync files, you must link an account in the **Synchronize** sub-menu.&#10;    &#10;&#10;Open a file&#10;-----------&#10;&#10;You can open a file from **Google Drive** , **Dropbox** or **GitHub** by opening the **Synchronize** sub-menu and clicking **Open from** . Once opened in the workspace, any modification in the file will be automatically synced.&#10;&#10;Save a file&#10;-----------&#10;&#10;You can save any file of the workspace to **Google Drive** , **Dropbox** or **GitHub** by opening the **Synchronize** sub-menu and clicking **Save on** . Even if a file in the workspace is already synced, you can save it to another location. StackEdit can sync one file with multiple locations and accounts.&#10;&#10;Synchronize a file&#10;------------------&#10;&#10;Once your file is linked to a synchronized location, StackEdit will periodically synchronize it by downloading/uploading any modification. A merge will be performed if necessary and conflicts will be resolved.&#10;&#10;If you just have modified your file and you want to force syncing, click the **Synchronize now** button in the navigation bar.&#10;&#10;&gt; **Note:** The **Synchronize now** button is disabled if you have no file to synchronize.&#10;&#10;Manage file synchronization&#10;---------------------------&#10;&#10;Since one file can be synced with multiple locations, you can list and manage synchronized locations by clicking **File synchronization** in the **Synchronize** sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove synchronized locations that are linked to your file.&#10;&#10;Publication&#10;===========&#10;&#10;Publishing in StackEdit makes it simple for you to publish online your files. Once you&#8217;re happy with a file, you can publish it to different hosting platforms like **Blogger** , **Dropbox** , **Gist** , **GitHub** , **Google Drive** , **WordPress** and **Zendesk** . With [Handlebars templates](http://handlebarsjs.com/) , you have full control over what you export.&#10;&#10;&gt; Before starting to publish, you must link an account in the **Publish** sub-menu.&#10;&#10;Publish a File&#10;--------------&#10;&#10;You can publish your file by opening the **Publish** sub-menu and by clicking **Publish to** . For some locations, you can choose between the following formats:&#10;&#10;*   Markdown: publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it ( **GitHub** for instance),&#10;*   HTML: publish the file converted to HTML via a Handlebars template (on a blog for example).&#10;&#10;Update a publication&#10;--------------------&#10;&#10;After publishing, StackEdit keeps your file linked to that publication which makes it easy for you to re-publish it. Once you have modified your file and you want to update your publication, click on the **Publish now** button in the navigation bar.&#10;&#10;&gt; **Note:** The **Publish now** button is disabled if your file has not been published yet.&#10;&#10;Manage file publication&#10;-----------------------&#10;&#10;Since one file can be published to multiple locations, you can list and manage publish locations by clicking **File publication** in the **Publish** sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove publication locations that are linked to your file.&#10;&#10;Markdown extensions&#10;===================&#10;&#10;StackEdit extends the standard Markdown syntax by adding extra **Markdown extensions** , providing you with some nice features.&#10;&#10;&gt; **ProTip:** You can disable any **Markdown extension** in the **File properties** dialog.&#10;&#10;SmartyPants&#10;-----------&#10;&#10;SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into &#8220;smart&#8221; typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:&#10;&#10;ASCII&#10;&#10;HTML&#10;&#10;Single backticks&#10;&#10;`\'Isn\'t this fun?\'`&#10;&#10;&#8216;Isn&#8217;t this fun?&#8217;&#10;&#10;Quotes&#10;&#10;`&#34;Isn\'t this fun?&#34;`&#10;&#10;&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this fun?&#8221;&#10;&#10;Dashes&#10;&#10;`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`&#10;&#10;&#8211; is en-dash, &#8212; is em-dash&#10;&#10;KaTeX&#10;-----&#10;&#10;You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) :&#10;&#10;The _Gamma function_ satisfying \\\\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\\\\quad\\\\forall n\\\\in\\\\mathbb N is via the Euler integral&#10;&#10;\\\\Gamma(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\\\\,.&#10;&#10;&gt; You can find more information about **LaTeX** mathematical expressions [here](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) .&#10;&#10;UML diagrams&#10;------------&#10;&#10;You can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/) . For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:&#10;&#10;    sequenceDiagram&#10;    Alice -&gt;&gt; Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?&#10;    Bob--&gt;&gt;John: How about you John?&#10;    Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!&#10;    Bob-x John: I am good thanks!&#10;    Note right of John: Bob thinks a long&lt;br/&gt;long time, so long&lt;br/&gt;that the text does&lt;br/&gt;not fit on a row.&#10;    &#10;    Bob--&gt;Alice: Checking with John...&#10;    Alice-&gt;John: Yes...

Having been in college for over 2 years, I understand the anxiety very well. Throughout those moments, I have undergone numerous panic attacks and eventually found a way to deal with it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n However, please understand that last-minute study for your exams is never encouraged! I have only done so for various reasons; for instance, I took a physics elective during my first semester of sophomore year because it was the only elective course that could fit into my most terrible timetable of all time. That course was a disaster. I never studied for it, until three days before the final exam, which was when I decided to sit for the exam instead of dropping the course (there was a midterm exam, obviously I screwed it up)! And it turned out that I passed the exam. In this article, I am going to summarize my findings and thoughts from those miserable experiences (which led to joyful results in the end).\r\n</p>\r\n<h1 id=\"what-you-need\">\r\n What you need\r\n</h1>\r\n<ol>\r\n <li>\r\n  <p>\r\n   A light heart.\r\n   <strong>\r\n    Don’t panic\r\n   </strong>\r\n   , you can do it! I have been through panic attacks a few times and mind you, I have never failed a single time.\r\n  </p>\r\n </li>\r\n <li>\r\n  <p>\r\n   If there are\r\n   <strong>\r\n    lecture notes\r\n   </strong>\r\n   , download and print them if you haven’t done so.\r\n  </p>\r\n </li>\r\n <li>\r\n  <p>\r\n   Otherwise, borrow notes from you classmates and copy them down.\r\n  </p>\r\n </li>\r\n <li>\r\n  <p>\r\n   <strong>\r\n    Past year exam questions\r\n   </strong>\r\n   , if available.\r\n  </p>\r\n </li>\r\n <li>\r\n  <p>\r\n   <strong>\r\n    Practice questions / tutorial questions\r\n   </strong>\r\n   (if you have some time).\r\n  </p>\r\n </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h1 id=\"strategy\">\r\n Strategy\r\n</h1>\r\n<h2 id=\"a-top-down-approach\">\r\n A top-down approach\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n This is the most efficient way of quick study I have found so far. Our goal is to have a high level understanding of what the course is about (in other words, see the\r\n <strong>\r\n  big picture\r\n </strong>\r\n ), not every detail of it, which will be the task of people who aim for full marks.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>\r\n  <p>\r\n   Read the\r\n   <strong>\r\n    table of contents\r\n   </strong>\r\n   . If they are slides, read the\r\n   <strong>\r\n    title\r\n   </strong>\r\n   of every chapter.\r\n  </p>\r\n </li>\r\n <li>\r\n  <p>\r\n   In every chapter, pay attention to\r\n   <strong>\r\n    headings\r\n   </strong>\r\n   ,\r\n   <strong>\r\n    sub-headings\r\n   </strong>\r\n   ,\r\n   <strong>\r\n    bold font text\r\n   </strong>\r\n   , etc. Highlight them and make sure that you understand what they mean.\r\n  </p>\r\n </li>\r\n <li>\r\n  <p>\r\n   In the meantime, construct an\r\n   <strong>\r\n    outline\r\n   </strong>\r\n   either on your mind or on a piece of paper. This will help you organize what you have learnt so far.\r\n  </p>\r\n </li>\r\n <li>\r\n  <p>\r\n   Last but not least,\r\n   <strong>\r\n    write something\r\n   </strong>\r\n   . Don’t just sit there and read. Write something and you will feel better.\r\n  </p>\r\n </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1 id=\"practice\">\r\n Practice\r\n</h1>\r\n<p>\r\n Now you have gained some basic understanding of the course, it is time to do some practice questions to strengthen your knowledge. In fact, many exam questions are highly similar to those practice questions that posted by the professor. If you have past exam questions, you are in luck!\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>\r\n  <p>\r\n   <strong>\r\n    Do simply questions\r\n   </strong>\r\n   , especially those directly linked to certain concepts.\r\n  </p>\r\n </li>\r\n <li>\r\n  <p>\r\n   <strong>\r\n    Pass on difficult questions\r\n   </strong>\r\n   . You have no time for that, and you won’t be able to reproduce them in the exam.\r\n  </p>\r\n </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1 id=\"case-study\">\r\n Case Study\r\n</h1>\r\n<h2 id=\"when-i-revised-for-cs-430\">\r\n When I revised for CS 430\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n I took this course during my exchange to the University of Waterloo. The name of the course is\r\n <em>\r\n  Application Software Engineering\r\n </em>\r\n , and it is a core requirement for my degree. It was a course that required lots of memorization. There was a really thick textbook and a bunch of text of every chapter. There were a few assignments, in which you were asked short-answer and long-answer questions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n Memorization has never been my strength. It is still one of the most painful thing to me. I have always preferred practical and logical stuff such as math over any subject that requires memorization. So it was probably not entirely my fault when I knew absolutely nothing before each assignment and exam. However, one thing that I am proud of is that I spent some time doing a quick study before every assignment or exam in a fashion described in this article, which helped me through every obstacle and passed it. Since it was taken during exchange, grade doesn’t matter as long as I passed.\r\n</p>\r\n',0),(24,'Ming','2018-04-11 03:03:39','2018-04-11 03:04:29','How to Do Well in Exams (Instead of Merely Pass)','how-to-do-well-in-exams-instead-of-merely-pass','<p>Dear Sir.

My dad would probably start insulting me seeing me like this, and he never chose not to do so when I was living with my parents. Throughout the years I had been actively seeking methods of pulling me together to a person that can control the way he lives. I have been reading a few self-help books that are proven to be effective, but not for me. Maybe they worked for one day or two, but they failed in the long run. Today, I still cannot get up early in the morning, cannot go to bed before late night, cannot focus on my studies when I am supposed to, cannot stay calm in rare occasions that I do focus on my studies and cannot start doing things early that are not due tomorrow.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n I should have gone for dinner half an hour ago, but there has been a strange force resisting me.

Applying the same ratio to Singapore implies an estimated number of 196,000 of sexual minorities. However, as of 2018, there is no anti-discrimination protection for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. A survey conducted by Nanyang Technological University (2013) shows that in 2010, 64.6% of respondents expressed negative attitudes towards homosexuality while 8.5% of them were neutral. This essay discusses a method to reduce misconceptions and discrimination against homosexual people (homophobia) within Singapore society by introducing sexual diversity and equality to primary and secondary education.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n One of the major factors that result in the overall negative attitudes towards homosexuality is the lack of awareness of sexual diversity and equality. In an open letter published by the Ministry of Education, Singapore, Liew stated that the current sexuality education programme was designed to teach values which the mainstream society believed, in which the importance of the heterosexual married family unit was emphasized (Ministry of Education, Singapore, 2012). The ignorance of diverse sexual orientations has led to severe mental problems among LGBT people. The survey conducted by Oogachaga Counselling and Support (2012) reveals that LGBT individuals who had experienced abuse or discrimination due to their sexual orientation reported a significantly higher incidence rate of behavioral issues and suicidal thoughts or attempts. Therefore, it is important to raise the awareness of LGBT equality in Singapore society.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n Although changing the social attitude is a long progress, it is believed that homophobia can be reduced in the long run by integrating sexual diversity and equality into primary and secondary education. The current sexual education program curriculum should be redesigned. In the new sexual education programme, students should be taught to understand the diversity of sexual orientations and to respect people with different sexual orientations, in the sense that they are all equal and deserving of the same rights. The teaching of sexual diversity and equality to children will increase a sense of visibility for LGBT students and reduce incidences of homophobia or closeted behavior (intentionally hiding sexual orientation due to social pressure), and eventually reduce homophobia in the society.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n However, integrating sexual diversity and equality into education is a tremendous challenge with respect to the conservative Singapore society. As of 2018, homosexuality is still criminalized in Singapore. Section 337A of the Penal Code of Singapore states that sexual activity between mutually consenting adult men will result in up to a 2-year imprisonment. Although the law is generally not enforced, it is considered to be one of the biggest obstacles in progressing towards a more LGBT acceptable society. In addition, Singapore has strong censorship against the homosexual presence in media. For example, in an episode of American talk show Ellen that aired in the United States on 12 February 2016, President Obama praised the openly gay talk show host Ellen DeGeneres for her role in advocating gay rights. The segment was edited out when it aired in Singapore on 23 February in compliance with Singapore’s Free-To-Air TV programme guidelines (the Strait Times, 2016). With the majority of Singapore society being conservative and the strong censorship, the difficulty of implementing the proposed solution can be foreseen.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n The lack of awareness of sexual diversity and equality among Singapore society has resulted in misconceptions and discrimination against homosexual people. The Ministry of Education should take measures to reduce homophobia by redesigning its current sexual education programme. With the LGBT community being accepted by more countries every year, it can be predicted that Singapore will become a LGBT-friendly society. However, it will be a long journey to get to that point.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n <strong>\r\n  References\r\n </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 90%\">\r\n<p>\r\n Gates, G. J.

It used to, I used to imagine myself doing a Master’s or even a PhD at one point when I was a bit younger. Once I’ve done three years in university that felt like certainly not for now. I did imagine myself getting a job for a few years and getting back for a Master’s. It’s not totally off the cards. I might at some point but it’s not likely anytime soon. Not in the next two years I don’t think. Maybe I’ll get really sick at the job and I wanna go back. But right now I am quite content with working instead of studying and I think it was difficult to justify sticking with academic because you have to be really committed to something quite specific to do, certainly to do a PhD and even to do a Master’s and I just didn’t feel that level of commitment and passion for something in theory and in computer science. I want to do more practical stuff. I want to do software development, and that it not really computer science.\r\n </p>\r\n <p>\r\n  Jake Wright, from\r\n  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AMqkTIs-ngQ?t=1h2m\">\r\n   (Un)employment Live Stream Q&amp;A\r\n  </a>\r\n </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n',1),(30,'Ming','2018-04-21 16:20:30','2018-04-21 16:21:16','Multi-destination Travel Route Planning - A Rough Idea','multidestination-travel-route-planning--a-rough-idea','<pre><code class=\"java\">// TODO\r\n</code></pre>\r\n',1),(31,'Ming','2018-04-23 19:30:52','2018-04-25 14:59:00','Exchange Semester in Waterloo, Canada','exchange-semester-in-waterloo-canada','<p>Spring has finally come to Waterloo and I just left the continent.
