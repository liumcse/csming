# CSMING - Open Source Personal Website

The initial version was built during the first month of my exchange term to University of Waterloo. This project heavily relies on Python Flask framework.

## Getting Started

To run the project, you will need

- Python 3 (refer to prerequisites for modules)
- MySQL

You will also need to add MySQL credentials into config.json file.

After configuration, run

```
$ python3 app.py
```

### Prerequisites

You need the following modules installed for Python 3

```

### Installing

It is strongly recommended that you run the project in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
